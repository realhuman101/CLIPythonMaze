# Python Maze

This is a simple maze game written in Python. It is entirely in the console.

To run this code, please first install the required libraries with the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the following command to start the game:

```shell
python main.py
```

## Scores

Scores are calculated based on how long it takes you to complete the maze. If you take past 1 hour to complete a maze, you do not get any points added. *(Points are calculated by: `1 hour - seconds taken to complete maze`/`3600 - seconds taken`)*
